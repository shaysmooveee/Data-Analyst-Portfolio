CREATE TABLE NBASTATS
(First_Name varchar (50),
Last_Name varchar (50),
Position varchar (50),
Team varchar (50),
Rebounds int,

 This is a query i wrote to create a table of NBA players' stats. I created this table to keep me interested and motivated in one of my first projects. 
 Ilove betting on sports and actually used this table to create a parlay.
