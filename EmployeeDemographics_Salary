Below is the data that i instered into two tables that i created using SQL
--INSERT INTO EmployeeDemographics VALUES
--(1002, 'Pam', 'Beasley', 30, 'Female'),
--(1003, 'Dwight', 'Schrute', 29, 'Male'),
--(1004, 'Angela', 'Martin', 31, 'Female'),
--(1005, 'Toby', 'Flenderson', 32, 'Male'),
--(1006, 'Michael', 'Scott', 35, 'Male'),
--(1007, 'Meridith', 'Paalmer', 32, 'Female'),
--(1008, 'Stanley', 'Hudson', 38, 'Male'),
--(1009, 'Kevin', 'Malone', 31, 'Male')


----INSERT INTO EmployeeSalary VALUES
----(1002, 'Receptionist', 36000),
----(1003, 'Salesman', 63000),
----(1004, 'Accountant', 47000),
----(1005, 'HR', 50000),
----(1006, 'Regional Manager',65000),
----(1007, 'Supplier Relations', 41000),
----(1008, 'Salesman', 48000),
----(1009, 'Accountant', 42000)


This is a query i wrote to find an anverage salary of employees who were accountants from two tables i created called EmployeeDemographics and EmployeeSalary.

SELECT Job_Title, AVG(Salary)
FROM SQLPractice.DBO.EmployeeDemographics
INNER JOIN SQLTutorial.dbo.EmployeeSalary
ON EmployeeDemographics.Employee_ID = EmployeeSalary.Employee_ID
WHERE Job_Title = 'Salesman'
GROUP BY Job_Title

Below are a few queries i wrote to utitlize different SQL functions like CASE, UNION, JOINS, AND ORDER BY to sort the data created in the two tables
EmployeeDemographics and EmployeeSalary
--SELECT *
--FROM SQLPractice.dbo.EmployeeDemographics

--SELECT *
--FROM SQLPractice.dbo.EmployeeSalary

--SELECT Employee_ID, First_Name, Age
--FROM SQLPractice.DBO.EmployeeDemographics
--UNION
--SELECT Employee_ID, Job_Title , Salary
--FROM SQLPractice.dbo.EmployeeSalary
--ORDER BY Employee_ID


--SELECT First_Name, Last_Name, Age,
--CASE
--WHEN Age = 38 THEN 'Stanley'
--WHEN Age > 30 THEN  'Old'
--ELSE 'Baby'
--END
--FROM SQLPractice.dbo.EmployeeDemographics
--WHERE Age is Not NULL
--ORDER BY Age



SELECT First_Name, Last_Name, Job_Title, Salary,
CASE
WHEN Job_Title = 'Salesman' THEN Salary + (Salary * .10)
WHEN Job_Title = 'Accountant' THEN Salary + (Salary *.05)
WHEN Job_Title= 'HR' THEN Salary + (Salary *.025)
ELSE Salary + (Salary * .03)
END AS Salary_After_Raise
FROM SQLPractice.dbo.EmployeeDemographics
JOIN SQLPractice.dbo.EmployeeSalary
ON EmployeeDemographics.Employee_ID = EmployeeSalary.Employee_ID
